\maketitle

In~\cite{BuchholtzFavonia18}, Buchholtz and Favonia develops a theory
of cellular cohomology in HoTT. This is done in two steps. Step 1 is
the construction of cohomology groups of (the skeleton of) a CW
complex using the usual definition via cochain complexes.  Step 2 is
the construction of an isomorphism between their definition of
cohomology the more well-established definition in terms of
Eilenberg-MacLane spaces (see~\cite{LicataFinster14}). Step 2 allows
the authors to infer all e.g. functoriality and the Eilenberg-Steenrod
axioms of their cohomology theory. Step 2 is, however, not as readily
available when developing cellular homology---despite homology having
been studied in HoTT~\cite{graham18,christensen2020hurewicz}, it
generally considered harder to work with than cohomology. \todo{blabla bla rewrite please...}

We revisit \cite{BuchholtzFavonia18} definition of cellular chain
complexes and develop a functorial homology theory, not via reduction
to another more well-studied homology theory, but via cellular
maps. This crucially relies on the so called \emph{cellular
  approximation theorem} which we prove (a constructive analogue of) in HoTT.

Let $\bN^{-} := \bN \cup \{-1\}$ and $\mathsf{Fin}(n)$ denote the $n$-element set. We will use the following definition of CW
\begin{definition}[CW skeleta]
  A \textbf{CW-skeleton} is an infinite sequence of types and maps
  \[X_{-1} \xrightarrow{\incl{-1}} X_0 \xrightarrow{\incl{0}} X_1 \xrightarrow{\incl{1}} \dots \]
  equppied with a function $c : \bN^- \to \bN$ and a set of attaching maps $\alpha_i : S^i \times \fin{c_i} \to X_i$ such that $X_{-1}$ is empty and the following square is a pushout:
  %
  \footnote{This definition is slightly different from the
  recursive definition employed in (the formalisation
  of)~\cite{BuchholtzFavonia18}. Its usefulness is two-fold: first, it
  allows us to also define infinite dimensional CW complexes, such as
  e.g. $\RPinf$. Second, it allows us to extract the $n$-skeleton,
  $X_n$, of a CW-skeleton $X_{(-)}$ directly without having to rely on
  auxilliary functions.}
  %
  \[
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]

	{X_i} \&\& {X_{i+1}}

A CW-skeleton is said to be \textbf{finite (of dimension $n$)} if $\incl{m}$ is an equivalence for all $m \geq n$.
\end{definition}
We denote by $\cwskelinf$the wild category whose objects are CW skeleta and whose morphisms are maps between their sequential colimits, i.e. $\mathsf{Hom}((X_i),(Y_i)) := (X_\infty \to Y_\infty)$. We denote by $\cwskel$ the category whose objects are the same but whose morphisms are \emph{cellular maps}:
\begin{definition}
  Let $(X_i)$ and $(Y_i)$ be CW skeleta. A \textbf{cellular map}, which we simply denote $f : (X_i) \to (Y_i)$, consists of a famly of functions $f_i : X_i \to Y_i$ for each $i \geq -1$ making the following diagram commute
  \[
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	{X_{i+1}} \&\& {Y_{i+1}} \\
	{X_i} \&\& {Y_i}
	\arrow["{f_{i+1}}", from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{f_{i}}"', from=2-1, to=2-3]
	\arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=1-1]
	\arrow[hook, from=2-3, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[CW complexes]\todo{Not sure if all these defs are needed...}
  A type $A$ is said to be a \textbf{CW complex} if there merely exists some CW skeleton $(X_i)$ such that $A$ is equivalent to the sequential colimit of $(X_i)$, i.e. $A \simeq X_\infty$. We say that $A$ is of \textbf{dimension $n$} if $(X_i)$ is finite of dimension $n$ and that $A$ is \textbf{finite} if there merely exists some $n$ such that $A$ is of dimension $n$.
\end{definition}

Let $\bZ[n]$ denote the free abelian group with $n-1$ generators with
$\bZ[0]$ defined to be the trivial group. Buchholtz and
Favonia~\cite{BuchholtzFavonia18} showed how to construct the chain
complex $\dots \xrightarrow{\partial_2} \bZ[c_{1}]
\xrightarrow{\partial_1} \bZ[c_{0}] \xrightarrow{\partial_0} 0$ associated to a CW-skeleton
$(X,\mathsf{incl},c,\alpha)$. We define $\hskel{n}: \cwskel \to \abgrp$ on objects by $\hskel{n}(X) := \mathsf{ker}(\partial_n)/\mathsf{im}(\partial_{n+1})$.
\begin{proposition}
  $\hskel{n}$ is functorial, i.e. for there is a functorial assignment of maps $f : (X_i) \to (Y_i)$, to homomorphisms $f_* : \hskel{n}(X) \to \hskel{n}(Y)$.
\end{proposition}
The proof is technical but follows a relatively standard argument~\todo{is this true? I barely remember anymore}.

Let us now try to lift this homology functor from
$\cwskel$ to
$\cwskelinf$. We define
$\hskelinf{n} : \cwskelinf \to
\abgrp$ on objects by $\hskelinf{n}(X) :=
H_n^{\mathsf{skel}}(X)$. Its action on morphisms, however, is much
less obvious. In order to reuse $\hskel{n}$, we need a way to lift maps $X_\infty \to Y_\infty$ to cellualr maps $(X_i) \to (Y_i)$. To this end, we have proved the following theorem.
%
%% Given a CW skeleton $(X_i)$, let $(X_i^{(n)})$ denote the subcomplex obtained by setting $X_i^{(n)} = \begin{cases} X_i & \text{ if $x \leq n$} \\ X_n &\text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$.
\begin{theorem}[Cellular approximation, part 1]
  Let $(X_i)$ and $(Y_i)$ be two finite CW skeleta and $f : X_{\infty} \to Y_{\infty}$ a map between their colimits. For any fixed $n \geq -1$, there merely exists a function $f$ \todo{finish}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Cellular approximation, part 2]
  Let $(X_i)$ and $(Y_i)$ be CW skeleta, $f$ and $g$ two cellular maps $(X_i) \to (Y_i)$ such that $f_\infty = g_\infty$. \todo{finish and better name?}
\end{theorem}
