abstract={In this note, we study the delooping of spaces and maps in homotopy type theory. We show that in some cases, spaces have a unique delooping, and give a simple  description of the delooping in these cases. We explain why some maps, such as group homomorphisms, have a unique delooping. We discuss some applications to Eilenberg--MacLane spaces  and cohomology.},
